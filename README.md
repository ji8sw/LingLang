# Ling Language

Ling is a simple, interpreted programming language created for fun and learning. It provides basic programming principles and is designed to be easy to use.

## Features

- **Variable Declaration**: Create and manipulate variables easily.
- **Print Statements**: Output text and variable contents to the console.
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition operations on variables and integers.
- **File-based Execution**: Run Ling scripts from text files.

## Usage

### Running a Ling Script

To run a Ling script, use the following command from a folder containing Ling.exe:

```
Ling script.ling
```
